# Brief Introduction

Built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js, this API is designed to deliver a robust and scalable backend for social media platforms. This API powers a social media application where users can create accounts, post content (text, photos, videos), and interact with posts through likes and dislikes. The API also supports fetching all posts in a user's timeline and allows users to follow one another.
